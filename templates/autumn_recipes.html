        <h3>Autumn Recipes</h3>
        <p> As the nights draw in and the long summer holidays end, there is a back-to-school feel in the air. Autumn with its golden mellow light, glorious colours and the rustle of fallen leaves is probably the most beautiful season. Take advantage of the trees being ladened with ripe apples, pears, plums and the hedgerows full of blackberries. Spend this time of year cooking our recipes in the warmth of your kitchen, and enjoy the gentle spices, and toasted nuts.   </p>
