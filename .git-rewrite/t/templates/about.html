<h1>About</h1>

<p>'Peaches in the Summer' was founded in early 2020 to celebrate and record English seasonal recipes. In this online cookery book, you'll find Easter rabbit biscuits, learn how to crystallise flowers, celebrate winter with a slice or two of a stunning chocolate and gold cake, or make your own maple and pecan leaves.</p>
<p>But we want you also to add, and edit your own recipes, perhaps your grandmother's pumpkin soup with sage butter, or that glorious 'Devil's Food cake' you discovered on a trip to the Lake District.</p>
<p>It's up to you, but, above all, have fun.</p>

        <p class="lead">Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most often
            named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>
